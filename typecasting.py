# typecasting is normaly change the variable into other variables for examples i am changing a string into inteager then this is called typecating #
a = "123"
b = 32
#now if we plus a + b then it show an error because a is not an inteager so we have to change now string into inteager and this is called typecastin#

print(int(a) + b)
